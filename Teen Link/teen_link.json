At the hospital, a social worker will discuss a victim’s options, including that of evidence collection. Because of this, it is helpful if the victim does not shower, clean up or change clothes before having an exam, as doing so may remove any remaining evidence. \n\nAdditionally, the doctor can discuss medications that are available to reduce the chances of contracting a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or getting pregnant. If the victim is under the age of 18, the law requires the police to be notified. However, going to the hospital and submitting a report does not necessarily mean that charges must be filed against the perpetrator or that participation in a legal case must occur. Counselors can talk about available alternatives and help the victim decide what the best choice is going to be for the individual.",

Are there three or more warning signs? \n2. Have the warning signs been present two weeks or longer? \n3. How extreme or severe are the warning signs? \n\nIf you are concerned that you or someone you know may be suicidal, it is important to address the situation immediately. Mentioning suicide will not give the person the idea or push them over the edge. Talking about your concerns can prevent a suicide attempt from occurring and save a life. \n\nHow to Help \nSTEPS 1 & 3 CAN BE USED TO HELP A FRIEND IN ANY SITUATION \n\n1. Show you care \n     - Talk to the person you are concerned about in a caring manner \n     - Be specific about the warning signs you have noticed \n     - Listen without judgment \n\n2. Ask the question directly \n    - “Are you thinking of suicide?” \n\n3. Talk to an adult you trust \n\nThese are the initial steps toward ongoing mental health care. Every situation regarding suicide is different.
